# Admin Dashboard

Admin Dashboard is the second project for the FullStack JavaScript module on The Odin Project. This mock admin dashboard was built as a way to showcase the CSS grid knowledge that has been taught so far in this course. The webpage is partially responsive, becoming a single column of content for mobile viewing.
